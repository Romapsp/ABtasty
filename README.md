# ABtasty

Welcome to my Test Repository! Feel free to check and go ahead the test project. 
I'm using POM model, trying to apply all modern principles, but I'm still a learner here, so slight mistakes might appear from time to time. 
I would be really grateful for a detailed feedback. 
As for the project: 
- you might find all tests inside the /tests folder
- page-objects are located in /tests/page-objects 
- utils are currently empty, it was added for future development and refinment
- the tests are located in tests/login.test.ts 

If any questions appear - feel free to contact me via email surkov.ron@gmail.com or in TG @rvsurkov
